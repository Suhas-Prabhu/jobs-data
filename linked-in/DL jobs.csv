We're building cloud-based tax compliance solutions to handle every transaction in the world.

Imagine every transaction you make — every tank of gas, cup of coffee, or pair of sneakers, every movie ticket, meal kit, or streamed song, every sensor-to-sensor ping. Nearly every time you make a purchase, physical or digital, there's an accompanying unique and nuanced tax compliance calculation.

The logic behind calculating taxes — the rules, rates, and boundaries — is a global, layered, three-dimensional mess of complexity, with compliance dictated by governments and applied by every business, every day.

Avalara works with businesses of all sizes, all over the world — from corner stores to gigantic global retailers — to calculate tax accurately and automatically, at speeds measured in milliseconds.

That's a massive technical challenge, in terms of scale, reliability, and complexity, and we do it better than anyone. That's why we're growing fast.

Headquartered in Seattle, Avalara has offices across the U.S. and around the world, in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, India, and the U.K.

Machine Learning Engineer

About This Role

As a ML engineer, you will be responsible for training and deployment of cutting edge machine learning and deep learning models for Drishti’s clients. The job would involve working with cutting edge computer vision models which are deployed on the manufacturing factory floor to provide insights to customers. The job would also involve optimizing the model performance, and tuning the heuristics to achieve the desired accuracies in production.

Minimum Qualification
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Data Science or related technical discipline.
Demonstrated proficiency in, at least, one modern programming language such as Python, Java, C++ or similar including object-oriented design.
Familiar with the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning.
Strong Computer Science and development fundamentals, including object-oriented design, data structures, algorithm design, and complexity analysis.
Familiarity with all of the following technologies: Docker, Git, Linux
Preferred Qualification
1+ years industry experience as a Data Scientist/ ML Engineer.
Prior professional experience of working on a Python tech stack.
Familiar with deep learning libraries such as Pytorch, Tensorflow
Familiarity with deep learning model architectures for object detection and action recognition
Experience with ML Platforms such as Kubeflow
Five Reasons To Work At Drishti
Work with visionaries who can execute: Our leadership team is comprised of heavy hitters from the AI and deep learning world. Check out their patents and publications, and see how their histories intertwine with the biggest movements in the last 30 years of technology. And imagine being on a first-name basis with them, solving hard technical problems side-by-side.
Tackle a massive market challenge: Manufacturing is a $12T industry that still uses 100-year-old techniques to gather data on human tasks. Which means that people, who still perform nearly 75 percent of factory activities, are effectively invisible to analytics. This situation severely hinders the decision-making abilities of the world’s largest manufacturing brands. The demand for a solution couldn’t be larger.
Do what you love – solve problems using tech: A problem of this magnitude requires the full force of technological solutions. You’ll take on neural network model accuracy, high-volume video transit and storage, Big Data analysis and much more. It’s the challenge – and the madness, and the fun – of building an SAP on top of a YouTube on top of a Nest.
Lead the charge from Bangalore: Drishti is a Series B funded Silicon Valley-based startup and funded by top venture capital investors that include Andreessen Horowitz, Emergence Capital, BGV, Sozo Ventures, Toyota AI Ventures etc. But – and this is critical for you – Drishti is building its product out of Bangalore. From our CTO on down, Bangalore is the heart and soul of Drishti’s engineering. You’ll be at the centre of the action.
Get exposure to deep learning: Deep learning technology is fundamental to what we do, and select engineers at Drishti have the opportunity to rotate into our deep learning group, to work alongside some of the foremost experts in the field.",,

Five Reasons To Work At Drishti
Work with visionaries who can execute: Our leadership team is comprised of heavy hitters from the AI and deep learning world. Check out their patents and publications, and see how their histories intertwine with the biggest movements in the last 30 years of technology. And imagine being on a first-name basis with them, solving hard technical problems side-by-side.
Tackle a massive market challenge: Manufacturing is a $12T industry that still uses 100-year-old techniques to gather data on human tasks. Which means that people, who still perform nearly 75 percent of factory activities, are effectively invisible to analytics. This situation severely hinders the decision-making abilities of the world’s largest manufacturing brands. The demand for a solution couldn’t be larger.
Do what you love – solve problems using tech: A problem of this magnitude requires the full force of technological solutions. You’ll take on neural network model accuracy, high-volume video transit and storage, Big Data analysis and much more. It’s the challenge – and the madness, and the fun – of building an SAP on top of a YouTube on top of a Nest.
Lead the charge from Bangalore: Drishti is a Series B funded Silicon Valley-based startup and funded by top venture capital investors that include Andreessen Horowitz, Emergence Capital, BGV, Sozo Ventures, Toyota AI Ventures etc. But – and this is critical for you – Drishti is building its product out of Bangalore. From our CTO on down, Bangalore is the heart and soul of Drishti’s engineering. You’ll be at the centre of the action.
Get exposure to deep learning: Deep learning technology is fundamental to what we do, and select engineers at Drishti have the opportunity to rotate into our deep learning group, to work alongside some of the foremost experts in the field.",,

Description

Amazon is the 4th most popular site in the US. Our product search engine, one of the most heavily used services in the world, indexes billions of products and serves hundreds of millions of customers world-wide. We are working on a new initiative to transform our search engine into a shopping engine that assists customers with their shopping missions. We’re looking at every aspect of search, from query understanding to front-end UX, ranking and relevance, indexing and tiering and asking how we can make big step improvements by applying advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. This is a rare opportunity to develop cutting edge ML solutions and apply them to a search problem of this magnitude.

Some exciting questions that we expect to answer over the next few years include:
Can we deeply understand customer intent and personalize their search experience even when they type broad queries such as “dress” or “espresso machine”?
Can we reduce the cost of serving customer queries on Amazon by orders of magnitude using ML to predict n-grams and tuples that many queries decompose into, apply expensive ranking functions offline to identify the most relevant products that match these terms, and index these for efficient online retrieval? We expect this to lead to exciting research at the intersection of systems and ML
Can we deeply understand the catalog to surface products that offer the most value to a customer? The challenge here is that the definition of value is subjective and personal, and therefore requires a deeper understanding of the customers intent as well as preferences
Can we use deep learning to transfer behavioral signals from frequently purchased products in the head to products in the tail where behavioral signals are sparse? The challenge here is the scale, and the fact that the head and torso contain only a small fraction of products while the tail contains an overwhelmingly large fraction of the products in the catalog
We have hired ML experts from leading research labs and academia to spearhead this effort. Our research leaders include Trishul Chilimbi (formerly MSR), Inderjit Dhillon (UT Austin), Guy Lebanon (formerly Georgia Tech), and S.V.N. (Vishy) Vishwanathan (formerly UC Santa Cruz). We are looking to hire Software Development Engineers (SDEs) and ML Applied Scientists at all levels, with experience in Search, Personalization, NLP, Systems, ML, DL and UI Design.

Internship opportunities are also available throughout the year and we are flexible with duration and start dates. You will be working alongside world-class scientists and engineers to build next generation search systems and will be able to deploy your ML models into production. Our team is proud of its collaborative and open research environment, where long term thinking and risk taking are highly rewarded. We value academic collaborations and encourage our scientists and engineers to participate and publish in top conferences such as NIPS, ICML, KDD, SIGIR and WWW.

The Query Understanding Modeling team is responsible for developing and deploying state of the art machine learning and NLP models to extract semantic information on product search queries issued by millions of Amazon customers each day.

As a member of the Query Understanding Modeling team, you will:
Define, design and implement key initiatives in the Query Understanding area such as semantic parsing framework, query classification, query rewriting, knowledge graph
Work closely with other applied scientists, engineers, engineering and product managers to understand the current state of the system and drive new enhancements to the system
Write technical reports for scientific research and publish results in top conference
Use statistical and machine learning techniques to create scalable text understanding systems
Build a robust, scalable and an extensible platform which supports large scale data analyses, model development, training, validation and implementation
Estimate engineering effort, identify dependencies, plan implementation, roll outs, provide updates and work with partner teams on initiatives
You Will Love This Role Because You Will
Work on a world-class Query Understanding service that handles billions of requests per day and is an important component of Amazon Products
Learn state of the art in terms of AWS and NLP/ML technology and figure out creative ways to make these work at production scale
Gain exposure to the workings of the largest e-commerce search engine and an opportunity to work with a dynamic team to define and develop innovative solutions that will have a direct impact on Amazon product search
Work with large data sets to analyze and improve the search experience using various AWS technologies
Have access to Amazon's vast technical resources to get the job done
At Amazon Search, you’ll experience the benefits of working in a dynamic, entrepreneurial environment, while leveraging the resources of Amazon.com (AMZN), one of the world's leading internet companies. We provide a highly customer-centric, team-oriented environment in our offices located in Bangalore, India

Description

From Jeff Bezos’s, 2014 Amazon shareholder letter (http://tinyurl.com/q8zpobu): “Internally, Marketplace was known as SDP for Single Detail Page. The idea was to take our most valuable retail real estate – our product detail pages – and let third-party sellers compete against our own retail category managers.”
Today, millions of third party sellers offer products alongside Amazon Retail through the Amazon Marketplace. The Featured Merchant Algorithm team owns the system and algorithms that enables the above mentioned competition and selects the offers that are featured on the ‘Add to Cart’ button (aka the ‘Buy Box’) on Amazon’s most valuable retail real estate – the Product Detail Page referenced above. The team’s mission is to ensure that featured offers provide the best possible customer value based on factors including price, availability, delivery options and customer service.
The team leverages sophisticated machine learning, econometric, and big data technologies to help customers to discover the right products at the right prices from millions of trusted sellers billions of times a day. If you are looking for a career-defining opportunity on one of the most customer centric and business impacting teams within Amazon, we’d love to hear from you.
We’re looking for a scientist who can define the next generation of FMA ML based ranking, pricing and econometric models to further improve customer experience and customer trust on Amazon. This scientist will work with tech and business teams within and outside of FMA to think outside the box and design innovative models solutions for this scientifically complex business driving functionality.

Description

From Jeff Bezos’s, 2014 Amazon shareholder letter (http://tinyurl.com/q8zpobu): “Internally, Marketplace was known as SDP for Single Detail Page. The idea was to take our most valuable retail real estate – our product detail pages – and let third-party sellers compete against our own retail category managers.”

Today, millions of third party sellers offer products alongside Amazon Retail through the Amazon Marketplace. The Featured Merchant Algorithm team owns the system and algorithms that enables the above mentioned competition and selects the offers that are featured on the ‘Add to Cart’ button (aka the ‘Buy Box’) on Amazon’s most valuable retail real estate – the Product Detail Page referenced above. The team’s mission is to ensure that featured offers provide the best possible customer value based on factors including price, availability, delivery options and customer service.

The team leverages sophisticated machine learning, econometric, and big data technologies to help customers to discover the right products at the right prices from millions of trusted sellers billions of times a day. If you are looking for a career-defining opportunity on one of the most customer centric and business impacting teams within Amazon, we’d love to hear from you.

We’re looking for a scientist who can define the next generation of FMA ML based ranking, pricing and econometric models to further improve customer experience and customer trust on Amazon. This scientist will work with tech and business teams within and outside of FMA to think outside the box and design innovative models solutions for this scientifically complex business driving functionality.

Punchh is the leader in AI-powered loyalty, offer management, and customer engagement solutions for brick-and-mortar and online restaurants, convenience stores, and other retailers. Punchh brings the power of digital engagement to physical stores by delivering omnichannel experiences and personalization across the entire customer journey to drive same-store sales and customer lifetime value. Using pre-built integrations to 200+ third-party systems such as POS, Wi-Fi, kiosk, and payment providers, the Punchh platform delivers actionable, SKU-level data in real-time. Serving 200+ brands that span 100K+ stores in 20 different countries, Punchh customers include 5 of the top 100 North American convenience stores like Casey’s and Racetrac and 37 of the top 100 restaurant brands, including Papa John's, Denny’s, Focus Brands, and Yum! Brands (KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell). Punchh is headquartered in Silicon Valley with offices in Texas, Canada, and India. Punchh was built over eleven years by a seasoned leadership team with extensive experience in digital, marketing, CRM, and AI technologies, as well as deep knowledge of the restaurant and retail industries. In April of 2021, Punchh agreed to be acquired by PAR Technology Corporation (NYSE: PAR), a leading global provider of restaurant software.

PAR invented the FIRST point of sale terminal over 40 years ago, yet we operate much like a start-up at the forefront of restaurant technology. PAR’s solutions are used to serve tens of millions of guests every day in over 120 countries.

We believe our customers want technology that is open and fast that enables their ability to innovate. We’re looking for people who are hungry to go beyond the idea of ‘just a job’. PAR’s not for everyone though: We work hard, and we really reward success. We push ourselves and each other to be better every day. We’re ferocious in battle but gentle in spirit. We’re hands-on people. We keep our room clean and make our bed because details matter. We believe it is better to be fast than big, and that being both is best. We believe diversity creates strong systems and communities. We experiment. Sometimes we break things, but we learn quickly. We’re honest and our intentions are good. And we always offer the last slice of dessert to our guests. We’ve got each other’s and our customers’ backs no matter what

Punchh is seeking a full-time Senior Machine Learning Developer who will work on Punchh’s AI product line.

Company Description

Sense is a diverse, collaborative team tackling one of the most universal challenges in today’s workforce. With a mission to change the way companies engage with talent, we’re creating a better experience for employers, recruiters, and candidates. Your work at Sense will impact millions of people around the globe and will be instrumental in evolving an entire industry. Join us in shaping the workforce of the future!

Founded in 2015, Sense is a high-growth HR Tech SaaS startup with offices in the Bay Area and Bangalore. It has 150+ team members, serves 500+ customers, and has grown 100% year-over-year since launch. We have raised over $40M in funding, backed by GV (Google), Accel, and Avataar Ventures.

As a part of the Sense team, you’ll play an active role in shaping and developing our products and processes.

Job Description

Our customers say that finding the right candidates at the right time can be like finding a needle in a haystack. Sense, however, makes the whole process a lot less labor intensive for them. Agencies using Sense unlock the real power of recruiters, who don’t have to spend most of their time managing mechanical and repetitive tasks.

One of the most powerful tools in our portfolio is the virtual assistant, which we call Reva (Recruiting Virtual Assistant), aka the Chatbot. Reva today can handle tasks such as scheduling meetings, collecting information from candidates, find the best jobs for them based on this information, and even prescreen them. All conversations are fully designed by our customers, who can build, test, and send conversations to candidates or internal employees in a click of a button. But there's much more we (and our customers) want it to do.

With a growing number of customers and use cases, we need your help making Reva better, smarter, and capable of understanding a lot more than it can today. If you are a seasoned ML engineer (or data scientists with experience in applied ML), you are passionate about dialog systems, natural language processing, and/or textual analysis, this is the right opportunity for you!
